# 👋 **Evan Mc Donnell – Computing Graduate**

## 🎮 **About Me:**

I’m Evan, a computing graduate with experience in software development, cloud technologies, and data analytics.

My academic and practical background covers cloud architecture and full-stack development, with hands-on experience in AWS, Java, JavaScript, SQL, HTML/CSS, and C#. I am currently completing the **[Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst course](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/microsoft-power-bi-data-analyst)** to strengthen my data analytics skills, and I recently completed the **[Google Technical Support Fundamentals](https://www.coursera.org/learn/technical-support-fundamentals?specialization=google-it-support)** certification.

As the professional esports in-game leader (IGL) for WYLDE’s Rainbow Six Siege team, I developed strong leadership, strategic thinking, and high-pressure decision-making abilities - skills that translate directly into technical, collaborative, and fast-paced work environments.

I’m passionate about using technology to solve problems and using leadership to build efficient solutions and high-performing teams. I thrive in environments where strategy, teamwork, and innovation come together, whether in cloud infrastructure, software development, or project delivery.
