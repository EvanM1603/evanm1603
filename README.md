🎯 Evan Mc Donnell – Computing Graduate & Esports In-Game Leader

I’m Evan, a computing graduate with experience in software development, cloud technologies, and data analytics.

My academic and practical experience spans cloud architecture, distributed systems, and software development, with hands-on knowledge of AWS, Java, JavaScript, SQL, HTML/CSS, and C#. I am currently completing the Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst course to further strengthen my data analytics capabilities, I also recently completed the Google Technical Support Fundamentals Course.

As the professional esports in-game leader (IGL) for WYLDE’s Rainbow Six Siege team, I developed strong leadership, strategic thinking, and high-pressure decision-making skills, experience that directly translates to tech and team-focused environments.

I am passionate about using technology to problem-solve and leadership to build efficient solutions and high-performing teams. I thrive in environments where strategy, collaboration, and innovation are key, whether in cloud infrastructure, software development, or project delivery.
